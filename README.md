### This is my first GitHub file

I am glad to learn how to **collaborate** using Git and GitHub. I have learnt the following in this class:
- What is Git?
- The advantages of Git
- What is GitHub?
- How to open an account in GitHub?

_Also, I created my first README file, and I successfully pushed it to GitHub_.

Thank you!!!
